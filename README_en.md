# ðŸ“Œ Akbank Deep Learning Bootcamp: Next-Gen Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an **image classification model** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture.  
Participants are expected to gain practical experience in the field of deep learning, including:  

- Image classification  
- Data analysis and preprocessing  
- Model development and optimization  
- Performance evaluation and interpretation  

---

## ðŸ“‚ About the Dataset
- The dataset consists of images from multiple classes.  
- Images are split into **training, validation, and test sets**.  
- **Data augmentation techniques** (rotation, zoom, flip, color jitter, etc.) are applied to improve generalization.  
- **Class imbalance issues** are handled using *class weights* and augmentation strategies.  

---

## ðŸ›  Methods Used
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks):** Feature extraction and classification from images  
- **Transfer Learning (EfficientNetB0):** Leveraging pre-trained models for better performance  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation  
- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
  - Confusion Matrix & Heatmap visualizations  

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- The model was successfully trained and achieved **high accuracy on the test set**.  
- **EarlyStopping** and **ModelCheckpoint** callbacks were applied to prevent overfitting.  
- Results were presented using **metrics and visualization plots**.  

---

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Training with larger and more diverse datasets  
- Comparison with other CNN architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, VGG)  
- Testing the model in **real-world scenarios**
